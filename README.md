Project Architecture: LambdaTest-Certifications

Project Structure

The project is organized into two main modules: main and test. Below is a detailed breakdown of the folder and file structure.

1. src/main/java

This module contains the core implementation of the project.

a. config

ConfigLoader: Handles loading configuration properties from external files such as config.properties.


b. pages

HomePage: Represents the Page Object Model (POM) for the homepage of the application. This includes methods and locators for interacting with the homepage.


c. setup

BaseTest: Provides a base class for all test classes, handling initialization of WebDriver, test setup, and teardown.

ObjectsFactory: Implements a factory design pattern to create and manage reusable objects like page instances.

PageActions: Encapsulates common actions like clicking, sending input, etc., to abstract WebDriver methods.

WebDriverManager: Manages WebDriver configurations and initialization, such as browser selection and driver settings.


d. utils

PageElement: Defines reusable components for interacting with elements, such as wait strategies or element verification.

WaitType: Contains enumerations or methods defining wait conditions like explicit waits, implicit waits, etc.


e. resources

config.properties: Contains project-specific configurations, such as URLs, credentials, timeouts, etc.

2. src/test/java

This module contains the test implementation for the project.

a. testcase

Test1, Test2, Test3: Individual test classes that extend BaseTest and execute test scenarios. Each test corresponds to specific functionality or user flows.


b. resources

Additional test-specific resources like test data or configurations can be stored here.

Key Features

Page Object Model (POM): Maintains modularity and readability of test scripts.

Centralized Configuration Management: The config.properties file stores essential configurations in one place.

Reusable Components: Encapsulation of common actions in PageActions and PageElement ensures minimal redundancy.

Scalable Test Framework: The BaseTest class provides a solid foundation to add new tests easily.


Usage

1. Update the config.properties file in src/main/resources with the required values.


2. Implement new pages in the pages package using the Page Object Model.


3. Write new test cases in src/test/java/testcase by extending BaseTest.


4. Run the test suite using your preferred test runner (e.g., Maven, TestNG, JUnit).
